# Trie, Compressed Trie, and KMP Comparison

## Overview
This project implements and compares three algorithms: Trie, Compressed Trie, and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string matching. The implementations are done in C++ and visualizations are created using matplotlib C++.

## Features
- Insert words into the Trie and Compressed Trie
- Search for words using Trie, Compressed Trie, and KMP
- Delete words from the Trie and Compressed Trie
- Autocomplete suggestions based on a prefix (Trie and Compressed Trie)
- Compare performance metrics: `elapsed time` and `comparison counts`

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trie-comparison.git
cd trie-comparison
```



## Visualization
The project uses matplotlib C++ for visualizing the performance metrics.
